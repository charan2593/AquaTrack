# SSL Certificate Fix for manage.purehomewaters.com

## Current Status: ✅ GOOD NEWS!
Your AquaFlow application IS working and deployed successfully!

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Application deployed and running
- ✅ Domain `manage.purehomewaters.com` pointing correctly
- ✅ React frontend loading
- ✅ DNS configuration correct

**Only Issue:** SSL Certificate mismatch

## Quick Fix for SSL Certificate

### Method 1: Wait for Automatic SSL Renewal
Replit sometimes takes time to generate the proper SSL certificate for custom domains.
- **Time:** Usually 10-60 minutes after domain verification
- **Check:** Try `https://manage.purehomewaters.com` periodically

### Method 2: Force SSL Certificate Regeneration
1. **In Replit Deployments → Domains:**
   - Remove `manage.purehomewaters.com`
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - Re-add `manage.purehomewaters.com`
   - This forces new SSL certificate generation

### Method 3: Temporary HTTP Access
For immediate testing while SSL fixes:
- Use: `http://manage.purehomewaters.com` (not HTTPS)
- Test login: 8500095021 / password
- Verify all features work

## Test Your Application NOW

### Option 1: HTTP (should work immediately)
`http://manage.purehomewaters.com`

### Option 2: HTTPS (may work after SSL regeneration)
`https://manage.purehomewaters.com`
