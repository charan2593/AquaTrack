# Option 1: Replit Deployment with Your Custom Domain

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Deploy on Replit

1. **Click the "Deploy" button** in your Replit interface (should be visible now)

2. **Choose Deployment Type:**
   - Select **"Autoscale Deployment"** (recommended for production)
   - This provides automatic scaling and load balancing

3. **Configure Deployment Settings:**
   - **Application Name:** AquaFlow
   - **Environment:** Production
   - **Build Command:** Already configured
   - **Start Command:** Already configured

### Phase 2: Add Your Custom Domain

1. **In the Deployment Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to the **"Domains"** tab
   - Click **"Add Custom Domain"**
   - Enter your Hostinger domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)

2. **Replit will provide DNS records:**
   ```
   A Record:
   Name: @ (or yourdomain.com)
   Value: [IP address provided by Replit]
   
   TXT Record:
   Name: @ (or yourdomain.com) 
   Value: [verification token from Replit]
   ```

### Phase 3: Configure Hostinger DNS

1. **Login to Hostinger Control Panel**

2. **Navigate to DNS Management:**
   - Go to **"Domains"** → Select your domain → **"DNS Zone"**

3. **Add the DNS Records:**
   - **Delete existing A record** pointing to Hostinger server
   - **Add new A record** with Replit's IP
   - **Add TXT record** for domain verification

4. **Save DNS Changes**

### Phase 4: Environment Variables

In your Replit deployment, set these environment variables:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=mysql://u866935527_phw_2025:your_password@82.25.121.32:3306/u866935527_purehomewaters
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
```

### Phase 5: Wait for DNS Propagation

- **Time:** 5 minutes to 48 hours (usually 10-30 minutes)
- **Check Status:** Domain will show "Verified" in Replit
- **Test:** Visit your domain to confirm it works
