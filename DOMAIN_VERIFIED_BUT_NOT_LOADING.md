# Domain Verified But Not Loading - Solution

## Current Status from Your Screenshot
- ✅ aqua-track-charanteja2593.replit.app (working)
- ✅ manage.purehomewaters.com ● Verified (but not loading)

## Issue Analysis
Domain is verified in DNS but Replit's SSL certificate and routing aren't fully configured for the custom domain.

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Force SSL Certificate Refresh
1. **Click the pencil icon** (✏️) next to `manage.purehomewaters.com`
2. **Remove the domain** temporarily
3. **Wait 3-5 minutes**
4. **Re-add `manage.purehomewaters.com`**
5. **Wait for verification** (should be quick since DNS is correct)

### Solution 2: Check Deployment Status
1. **Go to Overview tab** in your Deployments panel
2. **Verify deployment is "Running"** (not failed/crashed)
3. **Check recent logs** for any errors
4. **If deployment failed:** Redeploy with current working code

### Solution 3: Test HTTP vs HTTPS
The domain might work on HTTP while SSL certificate generates:
- Try: `http://manage.purehomewaters.com`
- Then: `https://manage.purehomewaters.com`

### Solution 4: Deployment Configuration Check
Ensure your deployment has correct settings:
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Start Command:** `npm run start` 
- **Environment Variables:** All production variables set

## Expected Timeline
- **Domain removal/re-add:** 2-3 minutes
- **SSL certificate generation:** 5-30 minutes
- **Full HTTPS functionality:** Within 1 hour

## Verification Steps After Fix
1. **Test:** https://manage.purehomewaters.com
2. **Login:** 8500095021 / password
3. **Verify:** Dashboard, customer management, all features
4. **Confirm:** Professional subdomain working

## If Still Not Working
Alternative approaches:
1. **Use CNAME record** instead of A record in Hostinger DNS
2. **Contact Replit support** for custom domain SSL issues
3. **Temporary workaround:** Use HTTP version while SSL resolves

Your AquaFlow application is fully functional - this is purely a domain routing/SSL configuration issue that should resolve with the domain refresh process.
