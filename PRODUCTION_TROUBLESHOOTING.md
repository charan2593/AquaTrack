# üîß Production Environment Troubleshooting

## Issue Identified
Your production environment at `manage.purehomewaters.com` is showing:
> "The requested endpoint could not be found, or you don't have access to it"

This error indicates the application is trying to connect to a PostgreSQL/Neon database that is no longer accessible.

## Root Cause
The production deployment is likely using the old database configuration instead of your MySQL database connection.

## Solution Required

### Step 1: Update Production Environment Variables
In your production hosting environment, ensure these variables are set:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL=mysql://u866935527_phw_2025:password@82.25.121.32:3306/u866935527_purehomewaters
PRODUCTION_SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret
```

### Step 2: Remove Old PostgreSQL Variables
Remove or comment out any old database variables:
```env
# Remove these old variables:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (old Neon database)
# PGUSER=...
# PGPASSWORD=...
# PGHOST=...
```

### Step 3: Verify Database Connection
The production environment should log:
```
[Database] Detected MySQL database (Hostinger)
[Database Config] Environment: production
```

## Expected Fix
Once the environment variables are updated, your production application should:
1. Connect to MySQL database instead of PostgreSQL
2. Load your existing customer data
3. Allow user authentication
4. Display the dashboard correctly

## If Issue Persists
1. Check application logs in your hosting environment
2. Verify MySQL database is accessible from production server
3. Ensure all required tables exist in production database
4. Confirm production build is using the latest code

## Current Status
‚úÖ Development environment working with MySQL
‚úÖ Production environment variables configured in Replit
‚ö†Ô∏è Production hosting environment needs variable updates

Your production issue should be resolved once the hosting environment is updated with the MySQL database connection.
