- âœ… `public/` - Your React frontend
- âœ… `package.json` - Production dependencies
- âœ… `shared/` - Database schema
- âœ… `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete guide

### Step 2: Upload to Your Hostinger Domain
1. **Login to Hostinger Control Panel**
2. **Go to File Manager**
3. **Navigate to your domain folder** (usually `public_html/yourdomain.com`)
4. **Upload the entire `/dist` folder contents**
   - You can zip the `/dist` folder and upload/extract it
   - Or upload files individually

### Step 3: Set Up Node.js Application

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
In Hostinger Terminal:
```bash
cd public_html/yourdomain.com
npm install
```

### Step 5: Environment Variables

```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=mysql://u866935527_phw_2025:your_password@82.25.121.32:3306/u866935527_purehomewaters
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
PORT=3000
```

### Step 6: Start Your Application
- **Save Configuration**
- **Start Application** from Hostinger panel
- **Enable SSL** (free with Hostinger)

### Step 7: Test Your Deployment
Visit your domain and test:
