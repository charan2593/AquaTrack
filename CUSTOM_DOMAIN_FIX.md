# Fix Custom Domain: manage.purehomewaters.com

## Current Situation
- ✅ **Working:** aqua-track-charanteja2593.replit.app
- ❌ **Not Working:** manage.purehomewaters.com
- ✅ **Domain Verified:** DNS pointing correctly

## Root Cause
This is a common Replit custom domain issue where:
1. SSL certificate hasn't been properly generated for custom domain
2. Domain verification completed but app routing not fully configured
3. Replit's proxy needs refresh for the custom domain

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Force SSL Certificate Regeneration
1. **In Replit Deployments → Domains tab:**
   - Click **Remove** next to `manage.purehomewaters.com`
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - Click **Add Domain** again
   - Enter: `manage.purehomewaters.com`
   - Wait for "Verified" status

### Step 2: Clear Replit's Internal Cache
Sometimes Replit needs to refresh its internal routing:
1. **Redeploy the application** after removing/re-adding domain
2. This forces Replit to regenerate all configurations

### Step 3: Alternative DNS Configuration
If the issue persists, try adding both records:
```
A Record:
Name: manage
Value: [current Replit IP]

CNAME Record:
Name: manage  
Value: aqua-track-charanteja2593.replit.app
```

### Step 4: Wait for SSL Propagation
- **Time:** 10-60 minutes after domain re-addition
- **Check:** SSL certificate generation in Replit panel
- **Test:** Both HTTP and HTTPS access

## Quick Test Commands
Since your Replit domain works, we can verify:
- **Working URL:** https://aqua-track-charanteja2593.replit.app
- **Target URL:** https://manage.purehomewaters.com (should work after fix)

## Immediate Action Plan
1. **Remove custom domain** from Replit
2. **Redeploy application**
3. **Re-add custom domain**
4. **Test after 15-30 minutes**

## Expected Result
Both URLs should work identically:
- aqua-track-charanteja2593.replit.app ✅
- manage.purehomewaters.com ✅

Your AquaFlow water purifier management system will be accessible at your professional domain with full functionality.
