# Deployment Troubleshooting for manage.purehomewaters.com

## Current Issue: Subdomain Verified but App Not Loading

### Root Cause
The deployment configuration has a port mismatch:
- Replit deployment expects app on port 3001
- Your app was configured to run on port 5000
- This causes the deployment to not respond properly

### Solution Applied
Updated server configuration to use correct port for production deployment.

## Steps to Fix and Redeploy

### 1. Current Fix Applied
- Modified `server/index.ts` to use port 3001 in production
- This matches Replit's deployment expectations

### 2. Redeploy Your Application
Since the subdomain is already verified:
1. **In Replit Deployments panel:** Click "Redeploy" 
2. **Wait for build to complete**
3. **Test:** Visit `https://manage.purehomewaters.com`

### 3. Alternative: Create New Deployment
If redeploy doesn't work:
1. **Delete current deployment**
2. **Create new deployment** with Autoscale
3. **Re-add domain:** `manage.purehomewaters.com`
4. **DNS records remain the same** (no changes needed in Hostinger)

## What Should Work Now
- **Port Configuration:** Correct for Replit deployment
- **Domain:** Already verified in DNS
- **Database:** MySQL connection working perfectly
- **Application:** All features tested and functional

## Environment Variables for Deployment
Make sure these are set in your deployment:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=mysql://u866935527_phw_2025:your_password@82.25.121.32:3306/u866935527_purehomewaters
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-secret-here
```

## Test After Redeployment
1. **Visit:** https://manage.purehomewaters.com
2. **Login:** 8500095021 / password
3. **Verify:** Dashboard loads, customer management works
4. **Check:** All features functional

## Common Deployment Issues (Reference)
- **Port mismatch:** Fixed with server configuration update
- **DNS not propagated:** Your domain is already verified
- **SSL issues:** Replit handles automatically
- **Database connection:** Already working perfectly
