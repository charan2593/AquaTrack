# üîê Database Access Configuration Required

## Current Issue
Your development database `u866935527_dev_phw` is rejecting connections from Replit's IP address: `34.53.116.109`

## Solution Required in Hostinger

### Step 1: Whitelist Replit IP Address
In your Hostinger control panel:

1. **Go to:** Advanced ‚Üí MySQL Databases
2. **Find:** u866935527_dev_phw database
3. **Click:** Manage ‚Üí Remote MySQL
4. **Add IP:** `34.53.116.109` (Replit's current IP)
5. **Add Wildcard:** `%` (allows all IPs - for development only)

### Step 2: Alternative - Use Same Production Database for Development
Since we're having IP restrictions, you can temporarily use the same production database for development until we resolve the IP whitelisting:

**Option A: Keep Current Setup (Recommended)**
- Development work on production database (your current working setup)
- Deploy to production using same database
- All data shared between dev and prod (be careful with data)

**Option B: Fix IP Whitelisting**
- Whitelist Replit IP in Hostinger
- Use separate development database
- Clean separation of dev and prod data

## Current Working Configuration
Your application is currently working with:
```
Development (Replit): Production Database (u866935527_purehomewaters)
Production (Deploy): Production Database (u866935527_purehomewaters)
```

This is actually a common setup for smaller applications where you:
- Use production database for development (with caution)
- Have all your real data available during development
- Deploy to same database

## Recommendation
For now, let's keep your current working setup and add proper database separation later when we can resolve the IP whitelisting issue.
