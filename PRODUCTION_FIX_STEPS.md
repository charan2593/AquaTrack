# ðŸš¨ Production Fix Required - manage.purehomewaters.com

## Current Problem
Your production website is showing "The requested endpoint could not be found" because it's trying to connect to an old PostgreSQL database that no longer exists.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Access Your Production Hosting Control Panel
Go to wherever you deployed `manage.purehomewaters.com` (likely Hostinger or similar hosting).

### 2. Update Environment Variables
In your production hosting environment, set these variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL=mysql://u866935527_phw_2025:G@R|H8KKjB6i@82.25.121.32:3306/u866935527_purehomewaters
PRODUCTION_SESSION_SECRET=prod-aquaflow-2025-secure-session-key
```

### 3. Remove Old Database Variables
Delete or comment out any old PostgreSQL variables:
- Any `DATABASE_URL` starting with `postgresql://`
- `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGHOST`, `PGDATABASE`

### 4. Restart Your Production Application
After updating the environment variables, restart your production application.

## What This Will Fix
âœ… Database connection errors
âœ… Login functionality  
âœ… Customer data access
âœ… Dashboard loading
âœ… All application features

## Expected Result
Once fixed, your production site should work exactly like your development environment - users can log in with their credentials and access all features.

## Alternative: Redeploy with New Configuration
If updating environment variables doesn't work, you can redeploy using the `/dist` folder which contains the updated configuration and built application.

Your application code is working perfectly - it just needs the correct database connection in production!
